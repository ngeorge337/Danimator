A ZDoom Animation Program!


=================
Setting Up
=================

1. Download the repo
2. Extract the dependencies folder which can be downloaded [from here](http://codingbuff.the-powerhouse.net/files/priv/DanimatorFiles/danimator_dependencies.zip)
file into the top-level directory (next to the solution file, /icons, /headers, etc.)
3. Open the solution with Visual Studio 2015
4. The project should build/compile without errors (in Release mode, compilation
might take some time because of Imagemagick. I plan to work on reducing the
feature set included in order to speed things up, hopefully).
