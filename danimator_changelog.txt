====================
Beta 2 Changelog
====================
-Fixed opening Project didn't set timeline max value of state correctly
-Fixed some rendering artifacts in the sprite view
-Fixed play/stop animation tooltip showing "play animation" when it should read "stop animation"
-Fixed being able to use the editor controls after deleting a state, causing possible crashes
-Fixed bug where an embedding option was not saving to config file
-Fixed some text alignments
-Fixed bug where you could delete the default blank sprite/sound options in the resource lists
-Fixed allowing one to open multiple code view windows
-Fixed potential bug where sprite offsets could be adjusted during animation playback
-Fixed size of File menu bitmaps being larger than intended
-Fixed adding sprite or sound resources of the same name not replacing already loaded ones (instead they are silently ignored; might revisit this in the future)
-Fixed allowing spaces in state names; all white space is now cleared from states when entered
-Fixed the "play sounds" option checkbox not actually working
-Project name now shows up in the titlebar when saved or loaded
-Slight change to DECORATE code formatting (one less tab indent)
-Reduced size of Code window a bit to accomodate (less screen cluttering)
-Lots of code refactoring for cleanliness (still not perfect though)
-Added bilinear filtering option to the Settings menu
-Removed the minimum 2-frame requirement; states can now be created with just 1 frame (if it is meant to be an empty state with just a flow control: add it into your code manually)
-Added mouse scroll wheel zooming and zooming capability
-Added data columns to state and resource lists indicating additional information like frame count, dimensions, etc.
-Added Undo/Redo system for most editing actions
-Added Stencil option to hide parts of the sprite frame that go outside of the visible area
-Added a current frame display in the status bar, indicating the current frame number in the timeline
-Replaced +/- icons for add/remove frame with new custom ones
-Increased range of X/Y offset spinners from +/-1024 to +/-65535 (kinda overkill but hey, it's allowed!)
-Added notification in status bar for when a save occurs
-Added TEXTUAL, a visual TEXTURES editor/compositor (see information below)
-Allowed access to Resource controls without states, due to the new save format accepting this and the introduction of TEXTUAL
-Added "Apply Sprite/Sound" buttons to the resource panels to remove the obscure method of utilizing them (though the old double-click ability is still present)
-Added an application icon (wowie!)
-Added a number of warnings for when potential errors or permanent actions are being taken. These warnings can be disabled in the Settings dialog
-Added a sprite previewer that displays above the resource list (can be disabled in the Settings dialog)
-Added drag and drop capability for sprites; one can now drop sprite images onto the appropriate resource list to load them
-Added a Batch Action dialog which allows (off)setting of sprite offsets or tics across multiple frames at once
-Added Copy and Paste actions for single animation frames
-Added the ability to export animation states to an animated GIF image via the right-click context menu (with some limitations; see below)
-Added an Import and Export options to the menu bar. Users can export loaded resources and custom textures to a .danres file which can then be imported into other projects as embedded data.
-Added the ability to import SNDINFO lumps. Danimator will ask for the lump, and then a base directory to search for sound files, then it will parse the SNDINFO and load appropriate sounds with matching SNDINFO entries.
