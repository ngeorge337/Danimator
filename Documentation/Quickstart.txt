Quickstart guide
1) Create a state, name it (Click this: 1)
2) Load some stuff (Drag and drop or click these: 2 3
Sounds require an SNDINFO alias.
3) Add or remove frames to the timeline: 4 5 6
4) Double-click an asset to attach it to a frame, or click these: 7 8
Repeat for all desired frames
5) Click and drag sprites around on the viewport, or use these to fine-tune alignment: 9 10 11 12
6) Set a frame's length: 13
7) Look at the resulting state code: 14
8) Modify the code's flow control: 15
9) Right-click entries in the state manager for these options: 16

Using TEXTURES:
1) Ensure all desired graphics are loaded into project
2) Click this, use suggested naming convention or be your own man:
3) Use these to determine the composite image's resulting size:
4) Add a layer by clicking this:
5) Attach sprites to layers by double-clicking or clicking this with file selected:
Repeat last two steps as desired
6) Manipulate layer order with these: 
7) Organize and duplicate your layers by right-clicking on them
8) Click this when you're done:
9) If you need to get back into the TEXTURES editor, right-click on your texture sprite in the file manager and click this:
10) And click this when you're ready to generate the TEXTURES lump for your project:

(Extra: You can use composite textures you define in TEXTURES as bases for new composite textures- as long as they're defined in Danimator first. Danimator will take care of the proper order for you automatically. Parsing imported TEXTURES code may come in the future.)

Animator functionality:
Stencil) This hides sprites that go past the visible boundary of the screen.
Crosshair) Draws a crosshair in the center of the viewport to aid in offsetting frames.
Ghosting/Ghost Frames) Draws previous frames before the currently selected frame as "ghost" frames. Aids in offsetting moving frames.
Loop) Loop) 

Settings:
Bilinear Filtering) Avoids certain viewport rendering artifacts. Can be disabled in settings.

TEXTURES functionality:
Namespace) Refer to http://zdoom.org/wiki/TEXTURES#Texture_properties
Color) Blend your layer's color to a specified RGB value.
Styles) Refer to http://zdoom.org/wiki/TEXTURES#Translucency 
As of writing, currently the only supported styles are CopyAlpha, Copy, Translucent, and Add. Modify your exported lump if you need something unsupported.
Alpha) 

CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND NOTES:
-No traditional Flash state support yet.
-Non-essential blending modes aren't implemented yet.
-Danimator ignores any embedded offsets.

FAQ:
-WILL THIS HELP ME MAKE SPRITES/SOUNDS/ETC FROM SCRATCH?
nope. you will still need to know how to use an image/sound editor and some idea of how DECORATE weapons work for that- danimator's focus is on the code and animation aspect of decorate weapons.
if you're new and are looking to learn how to code weapons in zdoom, these two resources are a great starting point.

http://zdoom.org/wiki/DECORATE

we've also included some example wads and project files.

-CAN YOU USE THIS IN OTHER SOURCE PORTS?
danimator targets zdoom-derivative ports with some decorate support (minimum A_Offset support) and optionally, textures support. you can use this tool with GLOOME and Zandronum.
additional source ports may or may not be supported in the future.

-WHAT FORMATS CAN I USE
danimator is built mostly on SFML, but danimator will only handle common formats ZDoom and SFML support.
images: png, jpeg (non-progressive, library limitation), tga
audio: wav, ogg/vorbis, flac

-HOTKEYS?
Space = play/stop animation
Ctrl+Space = play from start
Ctrl+S = Save
Ctrl+N = New Project
Ctrl+O = Open Project
Ctrl+Z = Undo
Ctrl+Y = Redo
Ctrl+C = Copy frame
Ctrl+V = Paste frame

-MY OFFSETS LOOK WRONG IN-GAME BUT LOOK FINE IN THE EDITOR
make sure the assets in your wad don't have embedded [url=http://zdoom.org/wiki/GrAb]grAb[/url] offsets if your sprites are PNGs.

-THE SOUND IS WRONG/DOESN'T PLAY
make sure your SNDINFO lump aliases match your project's aliases and are properly imported.
